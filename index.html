				<h2>Create a New Application</h2>
			</header>
			<article>
				<p>You can install Ember with a single command using npm, the Node.js package manager. Type this into your terminal:</p>
				<div class="code">
					<code>npm install -g ember-cli</code>
				</div>
				<p>Don't have npm? <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node">Learn how to install Node.js and npm here.</a> For a full list of dependencies necessary for an Ember CLI project, consult our <a target="_blank" href="https://guides.emberjs.com/release/getting-started/" >Installing Ember</a> guide.</p>
				<p>
				Once you've installed Ember CLI via npm, you will have access to a new embercommand in your terminal. You can use the ember new command to create a new application.
				</p>
				<div class="code">
					<code>ember new ember-quickstart</code>
				</div>
				<p>This one command will create a new directory called ember-quickstart and set up a new Ember application inside of it. Out of the box, your application will include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>A development server.</li>
					<li>Template compilation.</li>
					<li>JavaScript and CSS minification.</li>
					<li>ES2015 features via Babel.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>By providing everything you need to build production-ready web applications in an integrated package, Ember makes starting new projects a breeze.</p>
				<p>Let's make sure everything is working properly. cd into the application directory ember-quickstart and start the development server by typing:</p>
				<div class="code">
					<code>cd ember-quickstart<br>
	ember serve
	</code>
		</div>
		    <p>After a few seconds, you should see output that looks like this:</p>
		    <div class="code"><code>
		    	Livereload server on http://localhost:7020<br>
Serving on http://localhost:4200/

		    </code></div>
		    <p>(To stop the server at any time, type Ctrl-C in your terminal.)</p>
		    <p>Open http://localhost:4200 in your browser of choice. You should see an Ember welcome page and not much else. Congratulations! You 		just created and booted your first Ember app.
					We will start by editing the application template. This template is always on screen while the user has your application loaded. In your editor, open app/templates/application.hbs and change it to the following:
				</p>
				<div class="code"><code>
					&lth1&gtPeopleTracker&lt/h1&gt<br>
					{{outlet}}
				</code></div>
				<p>Ember detects the changed file and automatically reloads the page for you in the background. You should see that the welcome page has been replaced by "PeopleTracker". You also added an {{outlet}} to this page, which means that any nested route will be rendered in that place.</p>
			</article>
		</section>
		
		<section class="main-section" id="Define a Route">
			<header>
				<h2>Define a Route</h2>
			</header>
			<article>
				<p>Let's build an application that shows a list of scientists. To do that, the first step is to create a route. For now, you can think of routes as being the different pages that make up your application</p>
				<p>Ember comes with generators that automate the boilerplate code for common tasks. To generate a route, type this in a new terminal window in your ember-quickstartdirectory:</p>
				<div class="code"><code>
					ember generate route scientists
				</code></div>
				<p>You'll see output like this:</p>
				<div class="code"><code>installing route<br>
						create app/routes/scientists.js<br>
						create app/templates/scientists.hbs<br>
					updating router<br>
						add route scientists<br>
					installing route-test<br>
						create tests/unit/routes/scientists-test.js
				</code></div>
				<p>That is Ember telling you that it has created:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>A template to be displayed when the user visits /scientists.</li>
					<li>A Route object that fetches the model used by that template.</li>
					<li>An entry in the application's router (located in app/router.js).</li>
					<li>A unit test for this route.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Open the newly-created template in app/templates/scientists.hbs and add the following HTML:</p>
				<div class="code"><code>
					&lth2&gtList of Scientists&lt/h2&gt
				</code></div>
				<p>In your browser, open http://localhost:4200/scientists. You should see the &lth2&gt you put in the scientists.hbs template, right below the &lth1&gt from our application.hbs template.</p>
				<p>Now that we've got the scientists template rendering, let's give it some data to render. We do that by specifying a model for that route, and we can specify a model by editing app/routes/scientists.js.
				We'll take the code created for us by the generator and add a model() method to the Route:
				</p>
				<div class="code"><code>import Route from '@ember/routing/route';<br>

					export default Route.extend({<br>
					+  model() {<br>
					+    return ['Marie Curie', 'Mae Jemison', 'Albert Hofmann'];<br>
					+  }<br>
					});
					</code></div>
					<p>This code example uses the latest features in JavaScript, some of which you may not be familiar with. Learn more with this <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/es6">overview of the newest JavaScript features.</a></p>
					<p>In a route's model() method, you return whatever data you want to make available to the template. If you need to fetch data asynchronously, the model() method supports any library that uses <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise">JavaScript Promises</a>.
						Now let's tell Ember how to turn that array of strings into HTML. Open the scientiststemplate and add the following code to loop through the array and print it:
						</p>
						<div class="code"><code>
							&lth2&gtList of Scientists&lt/h2&gt<br>

							+&ltul&gt<br>
							+  {{#each model as |scientist|}}<br>
							+    &ltli>{{scientist}}&lt/li&gt<br>
							+  {{/each}}<br>
							+&lt/ul&gt

						</code></div>
						<p>Here, we use the each helper to loop over each item in the array we provided from the model() hook and print it inside an &ltli&gt element.</p>

		<section class="main-section" id="Create a UI Component">
			<header>
				<h2>Create a UI Component</h2>
			</header>
			<article>
				<p>As your application grows, you will notice you are sharing UI elements between multiple pages, or using them multiple times on the same page. Ember makes it easy to refactor your templates into reusable components.</p>
				<p>Let's create a people-list component that we can use in multiple places to show a list of people.</p>
				<p>As usual, there's a generator that makes this easy for us. Make a new component by typing:</p>
				<div class="code"><code>
					ember generate component people-list
				</code></div>
				<p>Copy and paste the scientists template into the people-list component's template and edit it to look as follows:</p>
				<div class="code"><code>
					&lth2&gt{{title}}&lt/h2&gt<br>
					&ltul&gt<br>
					{{#each people as |person|}}<br>
						&ltli&gt{{person}}&lt/li&gt<br>
					{{/each}}<br>
					&lt/ul&gt
				</code></div>
				<p>Note that we've changed the title from a hard-coded string ("List of Scientists") to a dynamic property ({{title}}). We've also renamed scientist to the more-generic person, decreasing the coupling of our component to where it's used.</p>
				<p>Save this template and switch back to the scientists template. Replace all our old code with our new componentized version. Components look like HTML tags but instead of using angle brackets (&lttag&gt) they use double curly braces ({{component}}).</p>
				<p>We're going to tell our component:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>What title to use, via the title attribute.</li>
					<li>What array of people to use, via the people attribute. We'll provide this route's model as the list of people.</li>
				</ol>
				<div class="code"><code>
					-&lth2&gtList of Scientists&lt/h2&gt<br>
					-
					-&ltul&gt<br>
					-  {{#each model as |scientist|}}<br>
					-    &ltli&gt{{scientist}}&lt/li&gt<br>
					-  {{/each}}<br>
					-&lt/ul&gt<br>
					+{{people-list title="List of Scientists" people=model}}
				</code></div>
				<p>Go back to your browser and you should see that the UI looks identical. The only difference is that now we've componentized our list into a version that's more reusable and more maintainable.</p>
				<p>You can see this in action if you create a new route that shows a different list of people. As an exercise for the reader, you may try to create a programmers route that shows a list of famous programmers. By re-using the people-list component, you can do it in almost no code at all.
				So far, your application is listing data, but there is no way for the user to interact with the information. In web applications you often want to listen for user events like clicks or hovers. Ember makes this easy to do. First add an action helper to the li in your people-list component.</p>
				<div class="code"><code>
					&lth2&gt{{title}}&lt/h2&gt<br>

					&ltul&gt<br>
						{{#each people as |person|}}<br>
					-    &ltli&gt{{person}}&lt/li&gt<br>
					+    &ltli&gt {{action "showPerson" person}}>{{person}}&lt/li&gt<br>
						{{/each}}<br>
					&lt/ul&gt
				</code></div>
				<p>The action helper allows you to add event listeners to elements and call named functions. By default, the action helper adds a click event listener, but it can be used to listen for any element event. Now, when the li element is clicked a showPersonfunction will be called from the actions object in the people-list component. Think of this like calling this.actions.showPerson(person) from our template.</p>
				<p>To handle this function call you need to modify the people-list component file to add the function to be called. In the component, add an actions object with a showPersonfunction that alerts the first argument.</p>
				<div class="code"><code>
					import Component from '@ember/component';<br>

						export default Component.extend({<br>
						+  actions: {<br>
						+    showPerson(person) {<br>
						+      alert(person);<br>
						+    }<br>
						+  }<br>
						});
				</code></div>
				<p>Now in the browser when a scientist's name is clicked, this function is called and the person's name is alerted.</p>

				<h2>The Parent Route</h2>
			</header>
			<article>
				<p>Previously, in the <a href="https://guides.emberjs.com/release/tutorial/routes-and-templates/">Routes and Templates tutorial</a>, we set up a rentals route.
					Opening the template for this route reveals an outlet underneath the route's general page information. At the bottom of the template, you'll notice an {{outlet}} helper. This is where the active nested route will be rendered.
					</p>
					<div class="code"><code>
						&ltdiv class="jumbo"&gt<br>
							&ltdiv class="right tomster"&gt&lt/div&gt<br>
							&lth2&gtWelcome!&lt/h2&gt<br>
							&ltp&gtWe hope you find exactly what you're looking for in a place to stay.&lt/p&gt<br>
							{{#link-to "about" class="button"}}<br>
								About Us<br>
							{{/link-to}}<br>
						&lt/div&gt<br>
						{{#list-filter<br>
							 filter=(action 'filterByCity')<br>
							 as |filteredResults|}}<br>
							&ltul class="results"&gt<br>
								{{#each filteredResults as |rentalUnit|}}<br>
									&ltli&gt{{rental-listing rental=rentalUnit}}&lt/li&gt<br>
								{{/each}}<br>
							&lt/ul&gt<br>
						{{/list-filter}}<br>
						{{outlet}}<br>

					</code></div>
					<p>Having a parent route means that any content on our parent route template will be present as we browse down through our child routes, allowing us to add things like common instructions, navigation, footers or sidebars.</p>

		<section class="main-section" id="Generating a Nested Index Route">
			<header>
				<h2>Generating a Nested Index Route</h2>
			</header>
			<article>
				<p>The first nested route to generate will be the index route. An index nested route works similarly to the base index route. It is the default route that renders when no route is provided. Therefore in our case, when we navigate to /rentals, Ember will attempt to load the rentals index route as a nested route.</p>
				<p>To create an index nested route, run the following command:</p>
				<div class="code"><code>
					ember g route rentals/index
				</code></div>
				<p>If you open up your Router (app/router.js) you may notice that the rentals line has changed. This extra function() {} is required because it needs a child route, the this.route('index', { path: '/'}); is implied.</p>
				<div class="code"><code>
					Router.map(function() {<br>
						this.route('about');<br>
						this.route('contact');<br>
						this.route('rentals', function() {});<br>
					});
				</code></div>
				<p>Much like how our application's index route doesn't appear in our Router, index routes on sub-routes won't explicitly appear in the Router either. Ember knows that the default action is to take the user to the index route. However, you can add the index route if you want to customize it. For example, you can modify the index route's path by specifying this.route('index', { path: '/custom-path'}).</p>
				<p>In the section on <a href="https://guides.emberjs.com/release/tutorial/ember-data/#toc_updating-the-model-hook">using Ember Data</a>, we added a call to fetch all rentals. Let's implement our newly generated rentals/index route by moving this findAll call from the parent rentals route to our new sub-route.</p>
				<div class="code"><code>
					import Route from '@ember/routing/route';<br>

					export default Route.extend({<br>
					-  model() {<br>
					-    return this.get('store').findAll('rental');<br>
					-  }<br>
					});
				</code></div>
				<div class="code"><code>
					import Route from '@ember/routing/route';<br>
					export default Route.extend({<br>
					+  model() {<br>
					+    return this.get('store').findAll('rental');<br>
					+  }<br>
					});
				</code></div>
				<p>Now that we are returning all of our rentals to the nested route's model, we will also move the rental list markup from our main route template to our nested route index template.</p>
				<div class="code"><code>
					&ltdiv class="jumbo"&gt<br>
					&ltdiv class="right tomster">&lt/div&gt<br>
					&lth2>Welcome!&lt/h2&gt<br>
					&ltp&gtWe hope you find exactly what you're looking for in a place to stay.&lt/p&gt<br>
					{{#link-to "about" class="button"}}<br>
						About Us<br>
					{{/link-to}}<br>
				&lt/div&gt<br>
				-{{#list-filter<br>
				-   filter=(action 'filterByCity')<br>
				-   as |filteredResults|}}<br>
				-  &ltul class="results"&gt<br>
				-    {{#each filteredResults as |rentalUnit|}}<br>
				-      &ltli&gt{{rental-listing rental=rentalUnit}}&lt/li&gt<br>
				-    {{/each}}<br>
				-  &lt/ul&gt<br>
				-{{/list-filter}}<br>
				{{outlet}}

				</code></div>
				<div class="code"><code>
					+{{#list-filter<br>
					+   filter=(action 'filterByCity')<br>
					+   as |filteredResults|}}<br>
					+  &ltul class="results"&gt<br>
					+    {{#each filteredResults as |rentalUnit|}}<br>
					+      &ltli&gt{{rental-listing rental=rentalUnit}}&lt/li&gt<br>
					+    {{/each}}<br>
					+  &lt/ul&gt<br>
					+{{/list-filter}}<br>
					{{outlet}}
				</code></div>
				<p>Finally, we need to make our controller that has our filter action available to the new nested index route.</p>
				<p>Start by running the following command to create an index controller for our nested route:</p>
				<div class="code"><code>
					ember g controller rentals/index
				</code></div>
				<p>Instead of copying the whole controller file over to app/controllers/rentals/index.jsfrom app/controllers/rentals.js, we'll just take advantage of JavaScript's import/export feature to re-export the rentals controller as the rentals/index controller:</p>
				<div class="code"><code>
					-import Controller from '@ember/controller';<br>
					+import RentalsController from '../rentals';<br>

					-export default Controller.extend({<br>
					-});<br>
					+export default RentalsController;
				</code></div>
			</article>
		</section>
		<section class="main-section" id="Generating a Nested Detail Route">
			<header >
				<h2>Generating a Nested Detail Route</h2>
			</header>
			<article>
				<p>Now that our API is ready to return individual rentals, we can generate our show sub-route. Much like generating our rentals route, we will use ember g to create a nested route.</p>
				<div class="code"><code>
					ember g route rentals/show
				</code></div>
				<p>ember g route rentals/show</p>
				<div class="code"><code>
					installing route<br>
						create app/routes/rentals/show.js<br>
						create app/templates/rentals/show.hbs<br>
					updating router<br>
						add route rentals/show<br>
					installing route-test<br>
						create tests/unit/routes/rentals/show-test.js<br>
				</code></div>
				<p>Let's start by looking at the changes to our Router (app/router.js).</p>
				<div class="code"><code>
					Router.map(function() {<br>
						this.route('about');<br>
						this.route('contact');<br>
						this.route('rentals', function() {<br>
					+    this.route('show');<br>
						});<br>
					});
				</code></div>
				<p>Our new route is nested within our rentals route. This tells Ember that it is a sub-route and will be accessed through localhost:4200/rentals/show.
				To tell the application which rental we want to access, we need to replace the show route path with the ID of the rental listing. We also want to simplify the URL so that it looks more like this: localhost:4200/rentals/id-for-rental.
				</p>
				<p>To do that, we modify our route as follows:</p>
				<div class="code"><code>
					Router.map(function() {<br>
						this.route('about');<br>
						this.route('contact');<br>
						this.route('rentals', function() {<br>
					-    this.route('show');<br>
					+    this.route('show', { path: '/:rental_id' });<br>
						});<br>
					});

				</code></div>
				<p>The rental_id will now be passed to the route.</p>
